# CS 769 Project: Multi-LLM Routing on Use Case and User Preferences
### Members: Abhijnya Menakur, Kumaresh Suresh Babu, and Kincannon Wilson

Our project is titled “**Multi-LLM Routing on Use Case and User Preferences**”. This project will be an extension to the paper “**RouterBench: A Benchmark for Multi-LLM Routing System**”. Our members are Abhijnya Menakur, Kumaresh Suresh Babu, and Kincannon Wilson. 

In addition, five members from the CS 839 course on Foundation Models are also contributing to the project. These members are Yancheng Zhu, Jiawei Zhang, Xinyue Lin, Tianyi Li, Fahad Touseef, and Aydan Bailey.

## Project Overview
Selecting the best Large Language Model (LLM) for specific use cases has become increasingly challenging due to the growing number of models with diverse performance, cost, and latency profiles. This work builds on existing benchmarks to develop a dynamic multi-LLM routing system that adapts to user-defined preferences. By incorporating advanced evaluation models and extending beyond text-based tasks to multimodal applications, our approach democratizes access to LLMs, enabling efficient, cost-effective, and user-centric routing.
